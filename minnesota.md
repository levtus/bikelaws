- Bicycle races, parades, contests, and other events on roads are allowed if approved by local authorities. Approval is given only if the event is reasonably safe for everyone involved and does not unreasonably disrupt traffic.

- With approval, participants in a bicycle event can be exempt from some traffic laws to ensure safety.

## 11. Police Bicycles
